        The aim of this project was to develop a website with a variety of interactive elements and sorting features,
        to gain practice using React and JavaScript. My plant nursery interface, Reactive Roots, allows users to add and remove items to cart, 
        calculates total price, and can filter items by a variety of different properties!
        <br><br>
        Reactive Roots is targeted for newer gardeners, so every plant has a difficulty rating and users are given
        the opportunity to sort items by difficulty so that they have an easier experience picking a suitable plant.
        Feel free to check out the website below:

       I learned how to use React and JavaScript through this project, but I also learned how to create an interface which
       is easily understandable, draws the eye to certain places on the website & creates an easy efficient experience tailored to their particular needs.
       I had a lot of fun designing this site and bringing it to life!
